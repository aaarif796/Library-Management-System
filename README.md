# Library Management System - Training Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step training assignment for building a Library Management System. The project demonstrates SQL relationships, data ingestion, and Django REST API development following Python best practices.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this assignment, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Git** - Version control system for tracking changes
   - [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   - [Git Basics Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

2. **uv** - Python package installer and environment manager
   - [uv Documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
   - [Getting Started with uv](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)

3. **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and code formatter
   - [Ruff Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
   - [Ruff Getting Started](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/)

4. **Swagger/OpenAPI** - API documentation and specification
   - [Swagger Documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/)
   - [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)

5. **Postman** - API testing tool
   - [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
   - [Postman Learning Center](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)

> **Note**: These topics will be covered in detail in the orientation handbook. The links provided are just starting points to familiarize yourself with these tools.

## Git Best Practices
Regular git commits are essential for:
- Tracking your progress
- Creating a history of your work
- Making it easier to revert changes if needed
- Demonstrating your understanding of version control

**Commit Guidelines:**
- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear commit messages
- Commit after completing a logical unit of work
- Push your changes regularly
