# Phase 3: Django REST API Development

## Overview
In this phase, you will build a RESTful API for the Library Management System using Django and Django REST Framework. You'll learn about API design, authentication, serialization, and testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand RESTful API design principles
- Implement a Django REST Framework API
- Create authentication and authorization systems
- Develop comprehensive API documentation
- Write tests for API endpoints

## Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup and Configuration

Set up a Django project with Django REST Framework.

#### Requirements:
- Initialize a Django project with appropriate settings
- Configure Django REST Framework
- Set up database connection to the existing database
- Configure URL routing
- Implement environment-based settings (development, testing, production)

**Deliverable:** Django project with basic configuration

### Task 2: Model Creation

Create Django models based on the database schema from Phase 1.

#### Requirements:
- Create models for all entities (Library, Book, Author, Category, Member, Borrowing, Review)
- Define appropriate relationships between models
- Implement model methods for business logic
- Add model validation
- Create database migrations

**Deliverable:** Django models

### Task 3: API Endpoints - Basic CRUD Operations

Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities.

#### Requirements:
- Create ViewSets or APIViews for each model
- Implement serializers for data validation and conversion
- Set up URL routing for all endpoints
- Implement filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Add proper HTTP status codes and error handling

**Endpoints to Implement:**
- `/api/libraries/` - List and create libraries
- `/api/books/` - List and create books
- `/api/authors/` - List and create authors
- `/api/categories/` - List and create categories
- `/api/members/` - List and create members
- `/api/borrowings/` - List and create borrowings
- `/api/reviews/` - List and create reviews

**Deliverable:** API endpoints for basic CRUD operations

### Task 5: Advanced API Endpoints

Implement advanced API endpoints for complex operations.

#### Requirements:
- Create endpoints for borrowing and returning books
- Implement search functionality across multiple models
- Create endpoints for book recommendations
- Implement endpoints for reporting and analytics
- Add nested serializers for complex data structures

**Endpoints to Implement:**
- `/api/books/search/` - Search books by title, author, category
- `/api/members/{id}/borrowings/` - Get borrowing history for a member
- `/api/books/{id}/availability/` - Check book availability
- `/api/books/borrow/` - Borrow a book
- `/api/books/return/` - Return a book
- `/api/statistics/` - Get library statistics

**Deliverable:** Advanced API endpoints

### Task 6: API Documentation

Create comprehensive API documentation.

#### Requirements:
- Implement Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Add detailed descriptions for all endpoints
- Include request and response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Create a Postman collection for API testing

**Deliverable:** API documentation with Swagger UI

### Task 7: Testing

Write tests for the API endpoints.

#### Requirements:
- Write unit tests for models and serializers
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement test fixtures and factories
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- Achieve at least 80% test coverage

**Deliverable:** Test suite for the API
